#### Model :
* It's a ML model and has the following:
                                1) Polynomial Feature (from Sklearn's preprocessin)
                                2) LassoLars (from Sklearn's linear_model)
                                3) Hyperparameters : alpha = 0.021,max_iter=150
* Data Preprocessing:
                    1) LabelEncoder (from Sklearn's preprocessing)
                    2) Binarizer (from Sklearn's preprocessing)
                    3) StandardScaler (from Sklearn's preprocessing)

**Data Preprocessing steps are saved as .sav file.(column_trans.2)**  
**Polynomial Transformation in also saved as .sav file.(Models/poly_trans.sav)**

#### Modules and Libraries required:
* Tensorflow (optional)
* Keras (optional)
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* tqdm
* Jupyter Notebook

#### Model Deployment:
Some thing come here  
under devlopment  
this space will be updated regularly

#### Mode Save:
* Model is saved as save as .sav file. (Models/final_model.sav)
