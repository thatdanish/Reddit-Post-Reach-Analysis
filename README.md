#### Model :
*It's a ML model and has the following:
                                *Polynomial Feature (from Sklearn's preprocessin)
                                *LassoLars (from Sklearn's linear_model)
                                *Hyperparameters : alpha = 0.021,max_iter=150
*Data Preprocessing:
                    *LabelEncoder (from Sklearn's preprocessing)
                    *Binarizer (from Sklearn's preprocessing)
                    *StandardScaler (from Sklearn's preprocessing)

                    **Data Preprocessing steps are saved as .sav file.(column_trans.2)**
                    **Polynomial Transformation in also saved as .sav file.(Models/poly_trans.sav)**

#### Modules and Libraries required:
*Tensorflow (optional)
*Keras (optional)
*Pandas
*Numpy
*Sklearn
*Matplotlib
*Seaborn
*tqdm
*Jupyter Notebook

#### Model Deployment:
*Some thing come here*  
*under devlopment*
*this space will be updated regularly*

#### Mode Save:
Model is saved as save as .sav file. (Models/final_model.sav)
